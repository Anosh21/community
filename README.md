# Milvus Community
Welcome to the Milvus community! The mission of the community is to make AI more easily accessible for more people. The main objective is to provide a platform where community members can share ideas, collaborate and learn from each other.

You can become a Milvus contributor in many different ways, we value all forms of contribution including but not limited to:

-   Improve code
-   Improve docs
-   Giving talks

## Communicating
The [communication][1] page lists communication channels like chat, issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

## Learn to build
Links in [devel/README.md][2] lead to many relevant technical topics.

## Contribute
A first step to contributing is to pick from the list of milvus SIGs. Start attending SIG meetings, join the slack channel and subscribe to the mailing list. SIGs will often have a set of "help wanted" issues that can help new contributors get involved.

The Contributor Guide provides detailed instruction on how to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted, including:

1.  How to file an issue
2.  How to find something to work on
3.  How to open a pull request

## Membership
We encourage all contributors to become members. We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers, and code owners. Learn more about requirements and responsibilities of membership in our Community Membership page.
